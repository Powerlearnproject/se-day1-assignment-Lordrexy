#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic process of building and maintaining a high quality and reliable software product using engineering principles, methodologies and tools. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The three key milstone involved are;
1. The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3. The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: Gatthering and documentation of user needs and system requirements. 
2. Design: The problem is identified and a detailed framework of the software architecture and user interface is designed.
3. Development: The solution to the problem is developed. The code is written and the building of software is done according to design specification.
4. Testing: the product developed is tested to ensure the software meets quality standard and functional requirements
5. Deployment: The software product is deployed for user or customers.
6. Maintenance: The product is constantly being updated, supported and enhanced after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

WATERFALL VS AGILE
In Waterfall, Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall is adopted.
While in Agile methodologies, iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change are implemented

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):  These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA. IDEs enhances productivity and code quality

Version Control Systems (VCS): These are libraries and frameworks for automating the testing process and ensuring software quality. Examples are JUnit, Selenium, Jest. VCS facilitates collaboration and productivity.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some of the challenges faced by software engineers are;
  -Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
  - 
The strategies for Overcoming Challenges are;
-effective communication,
-agile methodologies,
-prioritization of tasks, and
-regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Involves testing individual components or modules of software

Integration Testing: entails testing interactions between different components or subsystems

System Testing: consist of  testing the entire software system as a whole.

Acceptance Testing:ensures testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering is important in many real-world applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation tools. 
It helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. 

An example of a vague prompt is : "Fetch me an informtion about Software Engineering"
improved prompt: Fetch me information about software Engineering. Act like an advanced tutor, explaining its concepts to a five year old kid".

Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

The improved text is more effective because it is more clearer, concise and specific.
